This project visualizes how the matrix multiplication(also the inverse matrix multiplication) takes places inside the computer memory with the 
representation of tiled implementation. The visualization also focuses on the graph view which plots the running time 
of the matrix multiplication on different values of n, m and p which are the rows and columns of the input and 
the output matrices.
